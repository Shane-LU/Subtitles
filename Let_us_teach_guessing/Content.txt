What I am trying to present you today will not be a lecture.
It will be rather a demonstration or an experiment.
In this experiment or demonstration or whatever you like to call it,
has the aim to present to you my attitude to teaching.
You see, this is not a method, it is not a system.
Teaching is not a science, it’s an art.
You cannot put it clearly in a system,
but you may have an attitude to it.
This attitude cannot be easily described in words.
More in acts and I will show you that afterwards if I can,
but I can tell you a few slogans.
Let me put my first point in the question and answer form.
What is teaching? 
In my opinion, teaching is giving opportunity to the students to discover things by themselves. 
Not a teacher should tell the things to the students.
If they wish to learn, clearly, they have to discover it.
The second point: first guess then prove.
All great discoveries were made in this type.
The discoveries in the mind of Archimedes or Gauss or Newton, 
they are conceived this way or anyhow some of the important terms(?). 
Any kids in the classroom finds, thinks this way: first guess then prove.
My third point is a straightforward application of this point to Mathematics.
Mathematics seems to consist of proofs, but it’s not quite so.
Finished Mathematics consists of proofs. 
But Mathematics in the making consists of guesses.


Let us teach guessing

Introduction 
Professor R.A. Rosenbaum Wesleyan University

The academic ideal in mathematics as well as other disciplines is that of 
the scholar teacher, the person who can contribute notably to the world store of 
knowledge and understanding 
and who can also make other in their teaching effectiveness.

One man is acknowledged to be pro-eminent,  to be the paradigm
the archetype and model for us all.
This exemplar is George Polya. Much of Polya’s 
academic life was spent in Swiss land after his education in Budapest.

He came to the United States and joined Stanford faculty in 1942. 
He holds numbers of honorary degrees and has written many books and some 220 articles. Most of them proves
his imaginative mathematical research.

His contribution to the combined field of mathematics and mathematical education are unequal. 
The demonstration which you are about to see is truly un-rehearsed and spontaneous. 
It illustrates his extraordinary his uncanny ability to stimulate a group to guess intelligently to
make reasonable conjectures, 
a process which is essential to mathematical discovery.

Ladies and gentlemen, 
I don’t wish to give you a lecture but I wish to teach you about guessing. 
It’s very important part in life to be a good guesser. 
It’s very important part in mathematics. 
You wonder a little how. Because if anywhere, so in mathematics you have proofs. 
And only that is valid in mathematics (for its proofs?) 

What is tell it apart of guessing. Yes there is apart. 
Mathematics when it’s finished, complete or done, then it consists of proofs. 
But when it is discovered, it always starts with a guess. 
And I wish to give you a real experience of it.
So I don’t wish to give you a lecture. 
But we play together a guessing game. 
You should find out from your own experience what is reasonable guessing. 
Not wild guessing that get anywhere. 
Wild guesses that you don't have to learn in order to wild guess (?)
The less you know, the easier to make a wild guess. 
But an educated guessing, a reasonable guessing that is something else. 
That should be learned. 
In mathematics class (is) a good opportunity to learn. 
So we play together a guessing game. 
This like any other games, there is rules.
But the rules are very simple. 
And there are just two rules. 
One for those people who will know the answer to my question. I hope they are very few. 
But if you know my question, you know my problem, don’t answer my question. That will be unfair. 
if you know the answer in advance you will be guessing. (?)
You would spoil the fun of all of us. 
So don’t do that. 
However, if you don’t know the answer to my question, then don’t hold back. 
Don’t be bashful but guess.

Of course, your guess maybe wrong. 
but that’s fun of the art of guessing.(?)

Even if they are wrong, the wrong guess is helpful. (?)
The wrong guess leads you to a better guess, and to a still better guess.
Finally you get the truth. 
Well that’s enough introduction. 
Let’s go into the matter.

So I give you a problem to guess. 

It will be really a problem of solid geometry.
but you know solid geometry not much is there to know (?)

For instance, everybody know what is a plane.
A plane is very flat. 
The top of this desk. 
This is part of a plane. 
Or approximately, the better it is made, 
the smoother it is, the flatter it is 
the better it presents the ideal plane of mathematics
but the ideal plane of mathematic also
go in all directions. It is infinite
so you know what is a plane
it’s flat and infinite. 
Now my problem is about planes. 
Several of them.
And to tell the whole story, 
about 5 planes. 
So you image 5 planes. 
If you cut this room 
one plane, two planes, 3, 4, 5 planes.
Now these 5 planes cut the space in many parts or divisions or 
compartments or whatever you call it. 
And that is the question:
How many parts? 
This is my question. Or almost. There is something to be added. 
But I wait till you to find it out yourself. 
But you understand. 
Image a big piece of cheese. Some cheese you like. 
It may be green cheese.
Swiss cheese. whatever you like. And then you got
One, two, three, four, five.  very (?)
there are lots of many pieces.   

You have to guess how many. (?)

who is ready to say the guess?
don’t be bashful.
Go ahead. 
Say something. 
25
25
How did you get it? 
5 * 5
That’s an idea. 
There is some idea. Good. 
Anybody ready for other guess?
Yes, please.
32 
32?
have something behind you. 32. Interesting
Quite big number.
Still another guess?

Well that’s enough to start with. 
Can both guesses be correct?
Can both guesses be correct?
Yes. 
Yes?
Oh. That’s interesting. I didn't expect this answer.
But you may be right, who knows? 

(?)
All right. Any other guess?
Any other questions? 
Yes please.
I say 10 spaces.
10 spaces, 10, so many. 

Well we shall see who is right. 
but you see there is an other point.
Guessing is the important beginning of solving any problem.

The real problem is difficult. The real problem you cannot do it either way. Otherwise it won't become a problem. (?)

It belongs to the idea of the problem. with some difficulty. 
So if you cannot do a problem,
What to do?
Just wait for an idea? No 
The correct thing is try to image some easier problem, which could 
prepare you for the problem. 
Some easier problem which could help.
In this case, it is not very difficult. 
Image. 
You should be suspicious in life. 
So if I ask you 5 planes, then you should have
asked you self
Why does he ask just 5?
Why not 4?
Why not 6?
So what will you ask?
Yes?
I guess you mean, how many planes, say 3 planes
3 planes, good.

The simplest model will be 2 planes. 
the two planes 
Is that simplest?
1, 1 plane. Oh yes. 
So we have found the simplest. One. 
Yes. That it is. 

In mathematics, often the simplest is the best. 


So, here is. 
Here is for you one plane. 
Or you tell me that is just one line on the blackboard. 
Yes, it is true. 
But I mean in the following way:  

this line on the blackboard is the intersection of the blackboard with this plane
By this plane I am showing you a horizontal plane. 
In this horizontal plane could be the surface of quiet water of a reflecting bond. 
There is nothing else in the world. 
Just this surface. Over it air, under it water. 

So how many parts? Two. Good. 
Please. 
Could I add 12 to the guess?
12. Oh Yes. 
Guesses are always accepted. 12.
So… but in this case, there are just two parts. 
Is that clear? You see, 
But in mathematics, it’s an advantage. First of all
You can make yourself completely clear the simplest case. 
And they are useful. 

So in order not to forget it, I wish to note it down. So I have just one dividing plane. 
It's long to write dividing plane. So I just write ding.
And it’s just 1 dividing plane, then the number of parts is exactly two. 
Good. 
This was one. 
So what is the next case?
After one. 
What comes after one? 
Two. 
That’s good. So good. So great. Kids can already count to two. That's good.

So here. 
That is any plane drawn at random here. (?)
Or you see this is not a plane. Just a line. Yes. But I mean so. 
You will see this line is the intersection of the plane of the blackboard with such a plane. 

So you have two planes. One, two. 
How many parts do you see? 
Four. 
Please, answer loud. 
You can shout much louder. 
OK. So you have two planes, you have 4 parts. 
Good. 
Now what about 3 planes?
Well, I will tell you once, yes please.
Could I ask you a question? 
Yes, please, do ask questions. 
If the planes were parallel, would it still divide them in the (?)

Very good question. 
I am waiting just for your question.
That is a very good question. 

If all the planes are parallel, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then it’s not problem. 
If all 5 planes are parallel, use your imagination, like that. Then how many parts? 6

Well then, the whole problem will be over. This cannot be the question. 
Very good question. 
I wanted you to bring it out. 
Yes, my question was incompletely stated. And that was so intentionally. 

Because problems in life, even in science, they are often incompletely stated.  
You have to find out what the real question is. 

So my real question is, the planes should not be parallel. 
Or should not all pass through(?) the same point. 
They should be taken at random.

Here is one plane. Here. Let us (?) the plane. 
And then you wish to make other planes. 

Well, how should I make other plane? 
You could make on a piece of wood. You could make two planes. 
Well, It’s pretty difficult to make a good plane surface on the piece of wood. 

And you made one, then the second should be parallel. 
Do you think you will ever succeed? 
Maybe will be good enough for the piece of wood. You wouldn’t see the difference. 
But both were put far enough, very likely it will have little little inclination.
And when far enough, they will do what? They will not be parallel, they will meet, intersect. 

So you see, if the planes are taken at random. 
Then no two will be parallel, or no three will pass through the same line. 
That is almost impossible. 

Well I hope you have a sound idea about it. 

So these are two planes taken at random. 
Are you feel happy about your question? 
Yes. 
Good. That’s a very good question. 

Now look here. 
So one plane, two planes. How many parts? 
Four. Four. Good. 
Answer (?)
We got over it already. 

Now three planes. 
Three planes. 
It will be a better idea to put it just like so. That will be a better idea. 
? 
Oh I know. The blackboard that is the third plane. Good? It’s good enough for the third plane. 
Then look here. 
The two planes indicating by the lines and the blackboard. 
They are some of the parts are in the room in front of the blackboard. How many such? 
Four. 
Good. 
Some other parts are outside the room behind the blackboard. 
How many such? 
Four. 

So all together, how many? 
Eight. 
Good. Eight. 
Now look here. Perhaps the most important point. You understood now the problem. 

I have so little space. I must erase it. 
But here will come really the most important.

I wish to (?) hold you attention to the most important points in reasonable guessing. 
If had more time I will introduce each much slower,  
But we have little time?.
So I tell you one interesting important point in reasonable guess to think of. 
Extreme cases. 

For instance, in our case, such an extreme case will be that is no dividing plane. 
Number of dividing plane is 0. Well, then there is no divided.   
There is just one space. Good. 
Now, let me come to the next case. We have 4 dividing planes. 
Try to guess it. 4 dividing planes. How many parts? 
Wow, so many hands. 
You take it. 
Sixteen? 
Sixteen. 
Who seconds the motion?
Woo, everybody. Good. 
So 16. 

Well I must tell you that is a reasonable guess. 
And that it is now important to tell you the difference between a wild guess and a reasonable guess. 
A wild guess come just out of the blue(?), out of nothing. 
But a reasonable guess is based on something. 
For instance, this guess, 16, was based on observation. 
Before guessing 16, you observed the numbers. 1, 2, 4, 8. 
Well, what did you observe. What observation?
What did you observe?
They seem to be the powers of 2. 
Yes. Powers of 2. This is zero's power. First. Second. Third. 
Each is the double of the foregoing powers of 2. OK. 

So you observed a pattern, a regularity, a law. Pattern, Law, Regularity. 
Or whatever you can call it. (?)
You observed that. 
And there is one more point. 
Perhaps you did not pay attention to it but it's very important.
After having observed this pattern, you had some courage to say and thought. 
Or you didn’t see, you just thought it. Or you didn't think it.  
But I wish to point out that belongs to it. 
You see, and thought it will go on like that.
It is two not only in the cases observed, but in all the other cases. 
That's step of generalization. 


So we got 16 in a reasonable way of guessing. 
We observed. We found pattern. And we said and thought it will go on like this. 
We made generalization. 
This is very important. 
(I) wish to point out (that it is) very important (?)
You hear all the time about it. 
This is important in all the sciences. 
How do you call that?
When you get a generalization starting from observation. 
Observing low, generalized it. 
That has a name. 
Induction. That’s fine. 
Our science is inductive. It is. 
All our knowledge was obtained in this way. 
Well, with some (?) criticism.
There are some essential points about induction. 
So I must admit it is a reasonable guess.
But is it proofed? 
Is 16 certain or not? Yes or no.
No. 
Answer with more conviction. Louder. 
No. 

Now. Good. 
So I put a ? after 16. It is doubtful. 
Now you see what is very important in reasonable guessing. 
You shouldn't pull it back. That's not good. 
You can guess. 
What you should not do that you believe your own guesses.
Believing a little bit in your guess is healthy. (?)
But believe completely your guess, well that's the stand point of savagers, not of educated people. 
So you doubted. And that's not enough. You have to doubt your guesses. 
You have to test your guess. 
You have to check it. 
Your guess was a prediction. 
You predicted if I draw 4 planes at random, then there will be 16 pieces of space. 
You predicted that. 
BTW, I will tell you it is not very easy to image four planes at random in space.
except one point, something remarkable happens.
And that we can understand a little by the analogy of the the plane. 

Analogy is another important point in guessing.  

I discussed division of space by planes. 
Space divided by planes. 
But really simpler (is) division of a plane by straight lines. 
For instance, if I divide this plane by just one straight line, then how many parts are in the plane? 
Two?
Two. 
They have names. Call them they are two half planes.
That's what you wanted to say. 
Two half planes. Good. 
Let's note that. 
Planes divided by lines. 
If you divided by one line, there are two half planes. 
If you divide by two lines, on the blackboard, how many parts are there?
Four. 
Four. 

May I direct your attention to that all four parts are infinite. It's not bounded. You can go away in this part as far as you wish, from the point of intersection. All four parts are infinite.

But if you introduce a third line. Just random at any position. Like that. 
Then something happens. 
Then there is one division of the space (which is) more interesting than the others. It is bounded for all sides. It is finite. How do you call this part?

What is that? You don't know that?
Triangle. 
Yes. You know it. 
It's a triangle. 
So if you introduce 3 lines, then you introduce a triangle. 

I foresaw this difficulty, so I show you this same figure again.

By introducing three lines, you got a triangle finite.(?)

And in space, if you introduced a fourth plane, then something similar happens. 
You got a finite body. Four planes include (?)
What is the solid body (bound) by four planes? How do you call that? 
Tetrahedron. So that's the answer. 

That is the remarkable thing that happens. (?)

So there is the Tetrahedron. So if you introduce four planes, you get a finite part of the space.
That is the new thing that happens. 

After that it's easy to record, it is easy to visualize the whole situation. 
Of course, this planes (?) tetrahedron space.
But I have to make a picture, because this is go to infinite.

They still cut the space in many parts. 
One of them finite, the other go to infinite.

And how many should there be? 
What did you say? How many should there be? 
Now stick to your guess. Say what you did before. 16. 16. That's 16.
Now alright we shall see. 
Can you just by looking at them to count them? Can you? How many? 15. How did you come?

Are you sure that you counted it correct?

You see you could make mistakes in two ways. There is some parts you forgot. 

Some part you may count it twice. 
But you counted fifteen. 
Could you explain us how?
First I counted the tetrahedron, then you drawn small tetrahedrons at the vertices. (?) to go
Then there will be one for each edge of the Tetrahedron. 
Oh Yes. 
He is very clever. Very good. 
Did the others follow? Well, yes. I think he is right. It seems that he is right. 
I don't know. Of course. 
But it seems that he is right.
But in order that you follow. 
You see, you can do it by analogy. 
Consider first the similar case in the planes. 
If you have here three lines in the plane, how many parts?
How many parts?
Just look at it. Not difficult. 
Loud please. Seven. Yes. 
Now you can count these seven parts in various ways. 
One way of counting is the finite part is just one. 
This is the most interesting part. This is triangle. 
The others are infinite. And they are around it. 
I can count it easily. 

I put my finger here and start counting. 
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One and six make seven. 
Yes, that's good. But not good enough. 
Because this I cannot quite imitate in space. 
Also in space, all the parts are around, but not around exactly in the same way. 
They don't surround in exactly the same way. 
So we have to count it in the more sophisticated manner.

I will tell you how. There are really two different kinds of parts.

For instance, this part has in common with the triangle at a side. (?)
How many such? 
Three. 
Loud please.
Three. 

Good. But there are still the other case. 
This one has in common with the triangle at just the point, or you (might) wish to say, vertex. 
How many such? 
Three. 
Three again. 
Now 1 + 3 + 3 = 7
In easier way to count, 
I hope we can imitate it in space. 
That was your idea. Very good. 
So he was jumped ahead of all of us. 

So let me repeat the question. 
We have four planes, including a finite solid, a tetrahedron. 
And it cut space in several pieces. 
Inside of the tetrahedron is one of them, especially important. 
This is the only finite one. All the others are around. 
If you have to count, 
In one of your had already the good idea, 
I just try to bring everybody to the same point, how to count. 

So analogy to the case in the plane. 
Also here, finite part. 
Finite. 
So analogy between the plane. this figure, and space, that figure. 

Finite part in both cases, now how many? 
Here one the triangle, and there the tetrahedron. That is just one. 
So finite is just one. 

But as in the plane case, all the others are around have something common. 
For instance, there are some having face in common. 
For instance, this one. 
Goes through the whole face in common, a face. A triangle. A face. 
How many such?
Four. 

Even without looking at the figure I can see that you are right. 
Because you know that tetrahedron has four faces. 
But some others has less in common. 
Just an edge. Just an edge.
An infinite part like that. 
An infinite part like that. 

(?)
Such a cutting edge. 
How many such? 
Six. 
Six. 
Very good.
So having an edge in common. There are six. 
And there is one more. 
If there is less than an edge, just a point in common. 
just a point in common. 
They are very (?)

These are emphasis in the figure. 

There is one I can peek into below. I can peek from above. 

So how many such? 
Four. 

I think that's all vertex in common. 

How many all together. 
I am quite exited, aren't you?
1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15. 
15? But you told me 16. 

So what about the 16?

I think maybe this is the special case. Special case, because three of the planes have point in common. 
Well you are right. 
You should always raise doubt.

But I think it's the general case.
A special case for instance, when two planes are parallel. (?)
If one plane, changed a little, there is an intersection somewhere. (?)
But this is pretty hard (in our case). (If we) change the plane, quite some angle, not change (for the intersections). 

Yes, please. 

The case we did before when we thought it was 16. 

Which case we did before? 
On the board, when you represented the planes by those lines. 
And you had the forth plane represented by blackboard. 
This is about lines. This is about lines in the plane. 
But in the first case you represented plane by one of those lines.
The planes coming out of the blackboard. 
And you represent three planes by those three line. 
They were coming out like. 

Oh, from the blackboard. 
That was also a general case. 
If you change any directions.
You are right. You should always doubt. 
Don't believe anything.
But I think it looks to me a general. (?)
Yes. 
What is your?
I think we have 15 parts if all planes are intersected at one common point. 

One point. (?)
That is a very special case. 
Three planes intersecting one point. 
The forth should pass just through the point. Very special case.
It is a little more difficult. You don't have. 
But I can assure you there are still less parts of spaces (in that case). 

The new plane cut all the old pieces in two, then you have twice as many. Here we are missing.

I didn't quite get that. 

The new plane are speculation based on the fact that each additional plane would yield twice as many parts as the old. 

Well that is a speculation. 
That was your guess. That was your think. But it was different.(?)So she is right.

That was a speculation. That will be true if new plane cut all the old in two, but it doesn't. 


But it doesn't. That's right.
Now we agree. But it doesn't. 

Well, look here. It is right. Don't swallow anything easier.
It is, I think, it is an experience. 
16, that was a respectable guess. It was an inductive guess. Not a wild guess. 
It was a reasonable guess, inductive guess. 

Observe 1, 2, 4, 8. It was an obvious regularity. 
And it's a natural generalization to think it a 16. 
But that experience which I want to give you, if any of you will be a teacher, give it to your student.
It is the following: That just such reasonable, respectable guess maybe wrong. 
That's it. 
That's all. 

So he is right. 
It is wrong. 
15 is right. 

I have to erase it. 
But I hope it's not erased in your memory. They should stay. 
Reasonable guess may come out wrong. 

But I think we learned something. 
For instance, interesting things belong to this analogy.
Without analogy, which one of you very cleverly sensed at the beginning. 
Without analogy, it would have been much harder to find the number 15. 
It will be much hard to find the number 15. 

Another interesting case is extreme case. 

You can even combine both. 

We first just divided space by planes, then we divide plane by lines. 
This was an analogy case. 

Let's work it a little more. (?)

You have the plane.
If you have one dividing line, then you have two parts. Good.

If you have two dividing lines, it's four. 

If you have no dividing lines, how many parts? One. One. Just one plane.

If you have three dividing lines, how many parts? Look at the blackboard. So how many? Seven. Seven.

But we could go far. 

Space divided by planes, plane divided by lines. 
What comes after that?

In space you have three dimensions. It works after 2 cube, which is 8. Two to the fourth it doesn't work. And in plane you have two dimensions. So it falls down to the 2 cube. 

Good.
That's a clever conjecture. Very good. Very clever conjecture.
It goes to the third part because that space is 3 dimension. It goes to the second part because that is two dimensions.

Very clever. But I asked something else. (?)

Space divided by planes.It is my first kind of question.
Plane divided by lines. 

What next? 
Line divided by points. 
Line divided by points. 

That is much so simpler. Here is the line. If there is no dividing point then there is just one line. 
If there is one dividing point, how many pieces? Two. Two. Quite clearly.  
If you have two dividing points, how many pieces? Three. 
If I have three dividing points: 1, 2, 3. Now how many pieces? Four. 
How would it be with four dividing points? Five. 
And so on. 

You are courageous.
If you would have N dividing points, how many pieces?
N + 1. N + 1.
You see, that should give you if you are inclined to do something in research. 
This should give you an ambitious question. 
Here you got a formular.
What you should have a formula here. 
What happens if N lines divide plane, what happens if N planes divide the space?

This is an ambitious plan. 
You should be ambitious. If you have not ambitious, you won't get far.
You should be ambitious. In science. 
Other ways are not so good. 
But in science, you should be ambitious. 

Now we have little time.
So I would be quite happy if you would solve my original question fast.
If you have 5 dividing planes, then space is cut into how many parts? 
which number should come here?

We worked so much. 
We collected some results. 
His remark is very good. 

Here: one, two, four, eight. 
But that is the third power, space is three dimensional.
4th power, it doesn't work. (?)
Here: 1, 2, 4. Plane is two dimensional. The third power doesn't work. (?)

Line is how many dimensional? One. One.
One, zero, one. Two is already too high. It doesn't work anymore. 

So here is the clever guess. (?)

There is something in these numbers. 
Challenge to your guessing. (?)
What should I write here?

Looking at these table, what should I write here? Reasonable guess.
29. 
What?
29. 
29. 
Perhaps. 
28. 
28. 
28. Now I am short of space. 
21? 
21. 
Let's start on the top. 21. 

What do you say?
26. 
You say 26. 
So many different (guesses). 

Now let me take the last one. 

How do you come to 26? 
Could you explain your reasons for 26?
Yes. 
I looked into (?) the pattern in the numbers that are on the board. 
And I found that if you were working in the third column, that if you took the two preceding numbers in the other two columns and that column. 

OK. In the third column, for instance, you take 4. You take 4. 
Well, perhaps or in this column. 
Yes?
Well, to get the 8 in the third column I added

In the third row. The 8, to get two preceeding 
4 and 4. To get that second 4, 
makes 8. How do I get 7?
You add the numbers above and the one. 

How to get 4? 
The two tow.
4, 2 and 2. 
2, 1 and 1. 
2, 1 and 1. 

Seems to go.
And 15 how do you get that?  
OK. You add 8 and 7. Good.
So that is the pattern she discovered. 
How did she get 26? Anybody else? Anybody follows?
Yes. 
The 7 and 4 in the second and third column to get 11. 
7 and 4, if the pattern continues, that will get you 11. 
And 15 and 11 in the first and second column will get 26. 


This is a reasonable guess. 
A guess by induction. 
It's based on observation. 

On observation of the pattern, it is true that you must have still the courage to say and so on. (?) 

Is it right?
You had the courage. That's good for you. 
You had the courage to say and so on. 
If we go on. This will be go on.
So you had the courage. 
But tell me, is 11 proved? 
Yes or no? No.
Proved or not? No.
No more conviction you answer so weakly. (?)
Is 26 proved? Yes or no?
No. 
That was better. 
No. 
Now it's another question. 

Proved? No. It is not proved. 

Do you believe it? 
Do you believe it? 
Sort of. 
Sort of. That was a very good answer.
She is a cautious girl. 
You must be cautious in life. 
That's good for you. Yes. Sort of. 
You believe it in half and half. 
You believe not (as if) it is proved. (?)
That's fine.
Is it proved? No.

But I can tell you. Here I told you: one of the important point is to test your guess. 
This is maybe the most important for the scientist.
Test your guess. 
You have to test your guess. 

So we guessed 11 and 26, which is easier to guess? 11 or 26? 
11. 
Just in the plane, this I can do.
In space it's very difficult to diagram.
But in the plane, well I have to make one more line.
Any line here. 
OK. So complicated. 
So it was a prediction. 
She predicted, her method predicted 11. 
Now let's go catch her, shall we?

How many finite parts are there? 
Three. 
1, 2, 3. 
So finite parts are three. Finite. 
I just write it here. (?)
Now the infinite part, that's easy. They are all around. So I put here my finger and start counting. 
Where my finger is that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
3 + 8 = 11.
So what about the 11?
You could doubt.(?)
So 11 seems to be more than just a fact. (guess?)

I would be interested to know now what do you think. 
I am just interested in your opinion. 
26 was a guess. It is still a guess. 
But the situation is a little different. 
Now we have verified 11. 
This verification, could and perhaps should influence our conviction. 
So after the verification of 11, do you believe in 26 more or less? 
More. 
Excellent. 
Yes. I think that's the reasonable opinion. 

Because if 11 checks that shows that the underlining pattern has something. 
It gives us a little more credit to the underlining pattern, therefore 26. 

Proved? 
No.
So should you believe it? 
No.
Sort of. 
She seems (?)
She was sort of believing. 
Not completely. Because it is not proved. 
We didn't give a mathematic proof. 
What kind of proof did we give? Something important. 
Inductive evidence.

Mathematics is good to teach inductive evidence. 
And that's important. 
Everything serious we learned is based on inductive evidence.
But even that you can first learn mathematics. 

So 26 is not proved. If you look a little more, it can be proved. 
But that we cannot do here. 

You see, for us the most important point is (that) 
I want to tell you what is important in reasonable guessing. 

It's good to look at extreme cases. It is good to look at analogy.

Induction is very important. 
You will have to observe. You have to look at the world if you wish to see how it is.

But just looking at it is not enough. 

Then you observed, if you detect a pattern. 
If you detect a pattern in the behavior of boyfriend, that maybe very important. 
So detect a pattern. 
Then you have still the courage to say and so on.
Generalization of the pattern will go on. 
And altogether is induction, but perhaps the most important method(?) is to test the guess. 
This is the difference between the savage and the scientist. 
Savage believes and don't believe.
Savage believes and disbelieves. 
Scientist sort of believe all the time, never completely.
Everything could be changed. 
But some guesses are more respectable than the others, because they are better verified.
So you have to always think of testing your guess.

I wish to tell you a last story (so) that you shouldn't forget that.
So you have to test your guesses. 
And keep all these important difference. 
This is a fact, this is a guess. 
This distinction should be very clearly in your mind.

And story is just about that. 
Who should know these difference? 
The scientist.

If it's in England, the member of the royal society. 
All the senior scientists in England are members of the royal society.

And once Janet in the building of the royal society, ought to meet these distinction, between the fact and theory, between the fact and guess. 
(?)Sir John, who is the member of the royal society, came to a meeting a little late. He was in a hurry. 
But he had to give his hat in the cloak room and get a check (?) with a number. And people were in a hurry.

The man in the cloak, maybe just Janet (who was) on duty on the day. 
noticed that he was in a hurry. 

Please sir you go ahead, you just go ahead. I will give you a hat without a check. 

So Sir John then thankfully into the meeting.
(?) What will happen to his hat?
So however, as he came back, the man in the cloak room gave him his correct hat.

I don't know what happened to sir John, but he said (?): Well, how did you know that this is my hat?
And Janet: Well...
He answered very sharply: Sir, I don't know whether it is your hat, it is the hat you gave me.
