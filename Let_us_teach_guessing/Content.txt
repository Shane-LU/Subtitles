What I am trying to present you today will not be a lecture
it will be rather a demonstration or an experiment
In this experiment or demonstration or whatever you like to call it
has the aim to present to you my attitude to teaching
you see, this is not a method, it is not a system
teaching is not a science, it’s an art
you cannot put it clearly in a system 
but you may have an attitude to it
this attitude cannot be easily described inverts.
more in acts and I will show you that afterwards if I can 
but I can tell you a few slogans.
Let me put my first point in the question and answer form.
What is teaching? 
In my opinion, teaching is giving opportunity to the students to discover thinks by themselves. 
Not a teacher should tell the things to the students
If they wish to learn. Clearly, they have to discover it.
The second point: first guess then prove.
All great discoveries were made in this type.
The discoveries in the mind of Archimedes or Gauss or Newton, they are conceived this way or 
anyhow some of the important terms. (?)
Any kids in the classroom finds, thinks this way: first guess then prove.
My third point is a straightforward application of this point to Mathematics.
Mathematics seems to consist of proof, but it’s not quite so.
Finished Mathematics consists of proofs. But Mathematics in the making consists of guesses.


Let us teach guessing
A Demonstration with George Polya 1965 Mathematical association of America

produced for committee on Educational media
Mathematical association of America

Introduction 
Professor R.A. Rosenbaum Wesleyan University

The academic ideal in mathematics as well as other disciplines is that of 
the scholar teacher, the person who can contribute notably to the world store of 
knowledge and understanding 
and who can also make other in their teaching effectiveness

One man is acknowledged to be pro-eminent,  to be the paradigm
the archetype and model for us all.
This exemplar is George Polya. Much of Polya’s 
academic life was spent in Swiss land after his education in Budapest.

He came to the United States and joined Stanford faculty in 1942. 
He holds numbers of honorable degrees and has written many books and some 220 articles. Most of them proves
his imaginative mathematical research.

His contribution to the combined field of mathematics and mathematical education are unequal. 
The demonstration which you are about to see is truly un-rehearsed and spontaneous. 
It illustrates his extraordinary his uncanny ability to stimulate a group to guess intelligently to
make reasonable conjectures, 
a process which is essential to mathematical discovery.

Ladies and gentlemen, 
I don’t wish to give you a lecture but I wish to teach you about guessing. 
It’s very important part in life to be a good guesser, you see. 
It’s very important part in mathematics. 
You wonder a little how. Because if anywhere, so in mathematics you have proofs. 
And only that is valid in mathematics (for its proofs?) 

What is tell a part ? of guessing. Yes there is a part. 
Mathematics when it’s finished, complete or done, then it consists of proofs. 
But when it is discovered, it always starts with a guess. 
And I wish to give you a real experience of it.
So I don’t wish to give you a lecture. 
But we play together a guessing game. 
you should find out from your own experience what is reasonable guessing. 
Not wild guessing that get everywhere. 
wild guess ? to learn wild guess?
The less you know, the easier to make a wild guess. 
but an educated guessing, a reasonable guessing that is something else. 
That should be learned. 
in mathematics class a good opportunity to learn. 
So we play together a guessing game. 
This like any other games, there is rules. ?
But the rules are very simple. 
And there are just two rules. 
One for those people who will know the answer to my question. I hope they are very few. 
But if you know ? my question, ?

don’t answer my question. that will be unfair. 
if you know the answer in advance. 
You would spoil the fun of all of us. 
So don’t do that. 
However, if you don’t know the answer to my question, then don’t hold back. 
Don’t be bashful but guess.

of course, your guess maybe wrong. 
but that’s fun of the art of guessing.?

Even if they are wrong, the wrong guess is helpful. 
The wrong guess leads you to a better guess, and to a still better guess.
finally you get the truth. 
Well that’s enough introduction. 
Let’s go into the matter.

So I give you a problem to guess. 

It will be really a problem of solid geometry.
but you know solid geometry not much is there to know ?

For instance, everybody know what is a plane.
A plane is very flat. 
the top of this desk. 
This is part of a plane. 
Or approximately, the better it is made, 
the smoother it is the flatter it is 
the better it presents the ideal plane of mathematics
but the ideal mathematic plan
go in all directions it is infinite
so you know what is a plane
it’s flat and infinite. 
Now My problem is about planes. 
several of them.

5 planes. 
So you image 5 planes. 
If you cut 
one plane, two planes, 3, 4 5 planes.
Now 5 planes cut the space in many parts or divisions or 
compartments or whatever you call it. 
and that is the question:
How many parts? 
This is my question. Or almost. There is something to be added. 
Find the value itself. 
But you understand. 
Image a big piece of cheese. Some cheese you like. 
It may beGreen cheese.
Swiss cheese. whatever you like.
One, two, three, four five. 
there is 

have to guess how many. 

who is ready to say the guess?
don’t be bashful?

say something. 
25
How did you get it. 5 * 5
That’s an idea. 
There is some idea. 
Anybody other guess?
32 
32?
something behind you. 32. Interesting
Quite big number.
Still another guess. 

Well that’s enough to start with. 
Can both guesses be correct?
Can both guesses be correct?
Yes. 
Yes.
Oh. That’s interesting. expected
But you may be right, who knows? 

All right. Any other guess?
Any other questions. 
Yes please.
I say 10 spaces.
10 spaces, 10, so many. 
Well we shall see who is right. 
but you see there is an other point.
You see. 
Guessing is the important beginning of solving any problem

The real problem is difficult.

It belongs to the idea of the problem.
So if you cannot do a problem,
what to do?
just wait for an idea? No 
the correct thing is try to image some easier problem, which could
image
preparing for 
easy problem which could help.


you should be suspicious in life(you see). 
So if I ask you 5 plates, 
ask you self
why does he ask just 5?
why not 4?
why not 6?
so what will you ask?
yes?
I guess you mean, 
how many planes, say 3 planes
3 planes
good.

The simplest 
the two planes
is that simplest?
1, 1 plane. 
which simplest

in mathematics, often the simplest is the best. 


So, here is. Here is for you one plane. 
Or you tell me that is just one line on the blackboard. 
Yes, it is true. 
But I mean in the following way (you see):  

this line on the blackboard is the intersection of the blackboard with this plane(you see)
By this plane I am showing you a horizontal plane. 
Horizontal plane could be the surface of quiet water. of a reflecting bond. 
There is nothing else. 
Just this surface. Over it air, under it water. 

So how many parts? Two. Good. 
Please. 
Could I add 12 to the guess?
guesses are always accepted. 12.
So… but in this case, there are just two parts. 
Is that clear? You see, 
But in mathematics, it’s an advantage ? First of all
You can make yourself completely clear the simplest case. 
And it’s useful. 

So in order not to forget it, I wish to note it down. So I have just one dividing 
plane. 

Dividing plane. 
And it’s just 1 dividing plane, the number of parts is exactly two. 
Good. 
This was one. 
So what was the next case?
After one. 
What comes after one? 
Two. ?
That’s good. 

So here. 
Any plane. 
Or you see this is not a plane. Just a line. Yes. But I mean?
You will see this line is the intersection of the plane of the blackboard
with such a plane. 

So you have two planes. One, two. 
How many parts do you see? 
Four. 

You can shout much louder. 
Two planes, you have 4 parts. 
Good. 
Now what about 3 planes?
I will tell you once, yes please.
Could I ask you a question? 
Yes, please, do ask questions. 
If the planes were parallel, was it still divide them ?

Very good question. 
I am waiting just for your question.
This is a very good question. 

If all the planes are parallel, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then it’s not problem. 
If all 5 planes are parallel, your imagination,  
like that. Then how many parts? 6

Well then, the whole problem will be over. This cannot be the question. 
Very good question. 
I wanted you to putting it out. 
Yes, my question was incompletely stated.  And that was so intentionally (you see). 

Because problems in life, even in science, they are often incompletely stated.  
You have to find out what the real question is. 

So my real question is (you see), the planes should not be parrallel. 
Or should not all pass ? the same point. 
They should be taken at random.

Here is one plane. Here. Let us ? the plane. 
And then you wish to make other planes. 

Well, hopefully you can other plane. 
You see
You could make on a piece of wood. You can make two planes. 
Well, It’s pretty difficult to make a good plane surface on the surface of wood. 

And you make one, then the second should be parallel. 
Do you think you will ever succeed? 
Maybe will be good enough for the piece of wood. You wouldn’t see the different. 
But both were put far enough, very likely it will have little little inclination.
And when far enough, they will do what? they will meet, intersect. 

So you see, if the planes are taken? at random. 
Then no two will parallel, or no three will pass through the same line. 
That is almost impossible. 

Well I hope you have a sound ?

So these are two planes taken at random. 
You feel happy about your question? 
Yes. 
Good. That’s a very good question. 

Now look here. 
One plane, two planes. How many parts? 
Four. Four. Good. 
Answer ?
we got over it. 

Now three planes. 
Three planes. 
It will be a better idea to put it just. That will be a better idea. 
? 
Or I know. The blackboard that is the third plane. It’s good enough for the third plane. 
Then look here. 
The two planes indicateing by the lines and the blackboard. 
They are some of the parts are in the room in front of the blackboard. How many such? 
Four. 
Good. 
Some other parts are outside the room behind the blackboard. 
How many such? 
Four. 

So all together, how many? 
Eight. 
Good. Eight. 
Now look here. Perhaps the most important point. You understood now the problem. 

I have little space. I have to erase it. 
But here will come really the most important.

I wish to told you .. to the most important points in reasonable guessing. 
If had more time maybe introduce each much slower,  
But time? 
Tell you one interesting important point. 
extreme cases. 

For instance, in our case, such an extreme case will be 
0. Well, then   
There is just one space. Good. 
Now, let me come to the next case. We have 4 dividing planes. 
Try to guess it. 4 dividing planes. How many parts? 
Wow, so many hands. 
You take it. 
Sixteen? 
Sixteen. 
Who seconds the motion?
Good. 

Well I must tell you this is a reasonable guess. 
Tell the difference between a wild guess and a reasonable guess. 
A wild guess just come out of nothing. 
But a reasonable guess is based on something. 
This guess, 16 was based on observation. 
Before guessing 16, you observed the numbers. 1, 2, 4, 8. 
Well, what did you observe. What observation?
What did you observe?
They seem to be the powers of 2. 
Yes. Powers of 2. This is ? 
Each is the double of the foregoing power of 2. OK. 
Ok
So you observe a pattern, regularity, law. Regularity. 
You can call it. 
You observed that. 
And there is one more point. 
Perhaps you did not pay attention	to ?
After having observed this pattern, you had some courage to say. 
you didn’t sse. 
I wish to point out 
belongs to it. 
You see, in soon. 
It is through the case observed. 
Steps of generalization. 
So we got 16 in a reasonable way of guessing. 
We observed. We found the pattern. And we think it will go on like this. 
We made generalization. 
This is very important. 
You hear all the time about it. 
This is important in all the science. 
How do you call that?
Generalization starting from observation. 
Observed low, generalized. 
That has a name. 
Induction. That’s fine. 
Our science are inductive.
All our knowledge
 
There are some essential points about induction. 
So I must it is a reasonable guess?
Is it proofed? 
Is 16 certain or no? 
conviction. Loud.
