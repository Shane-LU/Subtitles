What I am trying to present you today will not be a lecture
it will be rather a demonstration or an experiment
In this experiment or demonstration or whatever you like to call it
has the aim to present to you my attitude to teaching
you see, this is not a method, it is not a system
teaching is not a science, it’s an art
you cannot put it clearly in a system 
but you may have an attitude to it
this attitude cannot be easily described inverts.
more in acts and I will show you that afterwards if I can 
but I can tell you a few slogans.
Let me put my first point in the question and answer form.
What is teaching? 
In my opinion, teaching is giving opportunity to the students to discover thinks by themselves. 
Not a teacher should tell the things to the students
If they wish to learn. Clearly, they have to discover it.
The second point: first guess then prove.
All great discoveries were made in this type.
The discoveries in the mind of Archimedes or Gauss or Newton, they are conceived this way or 
anyhow some of the important terms. (?)
Any kids in the classroom finds, thinks this way: first guess then prove.
My third point is a straightforward application of this point to Mathematics.
Mathematics seems to consist of proof, but it’s not quite so.
Finished Mathematics consists of proofs. But Mathematics in the making consists of guesses.


Let us teach guessing
A Demonstration with George Polya 1965 Mathematical association of America

Introduction 
Professor R.A. Rosenbaum Wesleyan University

The academic ideal in mathematics as well as other disciplines is that of 
the scholar teacher, the person who can contribute notably to the world store of 
knowledge and understanding 
and who can also make other in their teaching effectiveness

One man is acknowledged to be pro-eminent,  to be the paradigm
the archetype and model for us all.
This exemplar is George Polya. Much of Polya’s 
academic life was spent in Swiss land after his education in Budapest.

He came to the United States and joined Stanford faculty in 1942. 
He holds numbers of honorable degrees and has written many books and some 220 articles. Most of them proves
his imaginative mathematical research.

His contribution to the combined field of mathematics and mathematical education are unequal. 
The demonstration which you are about to see is truly un-rehearsed and spontaneous. 
It illustrates his extraordinary his uncanny ability to stimulate a group to guess intelligently to
make reasonable conjectures, 
a process which is essential to mathematical discovery.
(5: 56)

Ladies and gentlemen, 
I don’t wish to give you a lecture but I wish to teach you about guessing. 
It’s very important part in life to be a good guesser, you see. 
It’s very important part in mathematics. 
You wonder a little how. Because if anywhere, so in mathematics you have proofs. 
And only that is valid in mathematics (for its proofs?) 

What is tell a part ? of guessing. Yes there is a part. 
Mathematics when it’s finished, complete or done, then it consists of proofs. 
But when it is discovered, it always starts with a guess. 
And I wish to give you a real experience of it.
So I don’t wish to give you a lecture. 
But we play together a guessing game. 
you should find out from your own experience what is reasonable guessing. 
Not wild guessing that get anywhere. 
wild guess you don't have to learn in order to wild guess (?)
The less you know, the easier to make a wild guess. 
but an educated guessing, a reasonable guessing that is something else. 
That should be learned. 
in mathematics class a good opportunity to learn. 
So we play together a guessing game. 
This like any other games, there is rules.
But the rules are very simple. 
And there are just two rules. 
One for those people who will know the answer to my question. I hope they are very few. 
But if you know my question, you know my problem, don’t answer my question. that will be unfair. 
if you know the answer in advance. (?)
You would spoil the fun of all of us. 
So don’t do that. 
However, if you don’t know the answer to my question, then don’t hold back. 
Don’t be bashful but guess.

Of course, your guess maybe wrong. 
but that’s fun of the art of guessing.(?)

Even if they are wrong, the wrong guess is helpful. (?)
The wrong guess leads you to a better guess, and to a still better guess.
finally you get the truth. 
Well that’s enough introduction. 
Let’s go into the matter.

So I give you a problem to guess. 

It will be really a problem of solid geometry.
but you know solid geometry not much is there to know (?)

For instance, everybody know what is a plane.
A plane is very flat. 
the top of this desk. 
This is part of a plane. 
Or approximately, the better it is made, 
the smoother it is the flatter it is 
the better it presents the ideal plane of mathematics
but the ideal plane of mathematic also
go in all directions it is infinite
so you know what is a plane
it’s flat and infinite. 
Now my problem is about planes. 
several of them.
(?)
5 planes. 
So you image 5 planes. 
If you cut this room 
one plane, two planes, 3, 4 5 planes.
Now 5 planes cut the space in many parts or divisions or 
compartments or whatever you call it. 
and that is the question:
How many parts? 
This is my question. Or almost. There is something to be added. 
But I wait you to find the it yourself. 
But you understand. 
Image a big piece of cheese. Some cheese you like. 
It may be green cheese.
Swiss cheese. whatever you like. And then you got
One, two, three, four five.  very (?)
there are lots of pieces.   

have to guess how many. (?)

who is ready to say the guess?
don’t be bashful?
Go ahead. 
say something. 
25
25
How did you get it. 
5 * 5
That’s an idea. 
There is some idea. Good. 
Anybody ready for other guess?
32 
32?
something behind you. 32. Interesting
Quite big number.
Still another guess?

Well that’s enough to start with. 
Can both guesses be correct?
Can both guesses be correct?
Yes. 
Yes.
Oh. That’s interesting. I didn't expect this answer.
But you may be right, who knows? 

(?)
All right. Any other guess?
Any other questions. 
Yes please.
I say 10 spaces.
10 spaces, 10, so many. 
Well we shall see who is right. 
but you see there is an other point.
Guessing is the important beginning of solving any problem.

The real problem is difficult. The real problem is difficult so that it becomes a problem. (?)

It belongs to the idea of the problem. with some difficulty. 
So if you cannot do a problem,
what to do?
just wait for an idea? No 
the correct thing is try to image some easier problem, which could 
prepare you for the problem. 
Some easy problem which could help.
In this case, it is not very difficult. 
Image. 
you should be suspicious in life(you see). 
So if I ask you 5 plates, then you should have
asked you self
why does he ask just 5?
why not 4?
why not 6?
so what will you ask?
yes?
I guess you mean, how many planes, say 3 planes
3 planes good.

The simplest model will be 2 planes. 
the two planes is that simplest?
1, 1 plane. Oh yes. 
So we have found the simplest. One. 
Yes. That it is. 

In mathematics, often the simplest is the best. 


So, here is. 
Here is for you one plane. 
Or you tell me that is just one line on the blackboard. 
Yes, it is true. 
But I mean in the following way:  

this line on the blackboard is the intersection of the blackboard with this plane
By this plane I am showing you a horizontal plane. 
In this horizontal plane could be the surface of quiet water. of a reflecting bond. 
There is nothing else in the (?)
Just this surface. Over it air, under it water. 

So how many parts? Two. Good. 
Please. 
Could I add 12 to the guess?
12. Oh Yes. 
guesses are always accepted. 12.
So… but in this case, there are just two parts. 
Is that clear? You see, 
But in mathematics, it’s an advantage ? First of all
You can make yourself completely clear the simplest case. 
And they are useful. 

So in order not to forget it, I wish to note it down. So I have just one dividing plane. 
It's long to write dividing plane. So I just write ding.
And it’s just 1 dividing plane, then the number of parts is exactly two. 
Good. 
This was one. 
So what was the next case?
After one. 
What comes after one? 
Two. 
That’s good. So great. (?)

So here. 
Any plane. (?)
Or you see this is not a plane. Just a line. Yes. But I mean so. 
You will see this line is the intersection of the plane of the blackboard with such a plane. 

So you have two planes. One, two. 
How many parts do you see? 
Four. 
Please, answer loudly. 
You can shout much louder. 
OK. Two planes, you have 4 parts. 
Good. 
Now what about 3 planes?
Well, I will tell you once, yes please.
Could I ask you a question? 
Yes, please, do ask questions. 
If the planes were parallel, was it still divide them ?

Very good question. 
I am waiting just for your question.
This is a very good question. 

If all the planes are parallel, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then it’s not problem. 
If all 5 planes are parallel, your imagination, like that. Then how many parts? 6

Well then, the whole problem will be over. This cannot be the question. 
Very good question. 
I wanted you to putting it out. 
Yes, my question was incompletely stated.  And that was so intentionally. 

Because problems in life, even in science, they are often incompletely stated.  
You have to find out what the real question is. 

So my real question is (you see), the planes should not be parrallel. 
Or should not all pass (?) the same point. 
They should be taken at random.

Here is one plane. Here. Let us ? the plane. 
And then you wish to make other planes. 

Well, hopefully you can other plane. 
You see
You could make on a piece of wood. You could make two planes. 
Well, It’s pretty difficult to make a good plane surface on the surface of wood. 

And you make one, then the second should be parallel. 
Do you think you will ever succeed? 
Maybe will be good enough for the piece of wood. You wouldn’t see the difference. 
But both were put far enough, very likely it will have little little inclination.
And when far enough, they will do what? they will not be parallel, they will meet, intersect. 

So you see, if the planes are taken? at random. 
Then no two will parallel, or no three will pass through the same line. 
That is almost impossible. 

Well I hope you have a sound idea about it. 

So these are two planes taken at random. 
Are you feel happy about your question? 
Yes. 
Good. That’s a very good question. 

Now look here. 
So one plane, two planes. How many parts? 
Four. Four. Good. 
Answer (?)
we got over it. 

Now three planes. 
Three planes. 
It will be a better idea to put it just. That will be a better idea. 
? 
Or I know. The blackboard that is the third plane. It’s good enough for the third plane. 
Then look here. 
The two planes indicateing by the lines and the blackboard. 
They are some of the parts are in the room in front of the blackboard. How many such? 
Four. 
Good. 
Some other parts are outside the room behind the blackboard. 
How many such? 
Four. 

So all together, how many? 
Eight. 
Good. Eight. 
Now look here. Perhaps the most important point. You understood now the problem. 

I have little space. I must erase it. 
But here will come really the most important.

I wish to told you attention to the most important points in reasonable guessing. 
If had more time I will introduce each much slower,  
But time? 
So I tell you one interesting important point. 
Extreme cases. 

For instance, in our case, such an extreme case will be
Number of dividing plane will be 0. Well, then   
There is just one space. Good. 
Now, let me come to the next case. We have 4 dividing planes. 
Try to guess it. 4 dividing planes. How many parts? 
Wow, so many hands. 
You take it. 
Sixteen? 
Sixteen. 
Who seconds the motion?
Good. 
So 16. 

Well I must tell you that is a reasonable guess. 
It's the time to tell you the difference between a wild guess and a reasonable guess. 
A wild guess come just out of nothing. 
But a reasonable guess is based on something. 
For instance, this guess, 16 was based on observation. 
Before guessing 16, you observed the numbers. 1, 2, 4, 8. 
Well, what did you observe. What observation?
What did you observe?
They seem to be the powers of 2. 
Yes. Powers of 2. This is zero power (?)
Each is the double of the foregoing power of 2. OK. 

So you observe a pattern, regularity, law. Pattern, Law, Regularity. 
You can call it. (?)
You observed that. 
And there is one more point. 
Perhaps you did not pay attention	to it but it's very important.
After having observed this pattern, you had some courage to say or see. 
Or you didn’t see, you just saw it. Or you didn't think it.  
But I wish to point out that
belongs to it. 
You see, in soon. 
It will go ?
It is two not only in the cases observed, but in all the other cases. 


It is through the case observed. 
So ? Steps of generalization. 
So we got 16 in a reasonable way of guessing. 
We observed. We found pattern. And we think it will go on like this. 
We made generalization. 
This is very important. 
wish very important ?
You hear all the time about it. 
This is important in all the sciences. 
How do you call that?
When you get a generalization starting from observation. 
Observed low, generalized. 
That has a name. 
Induction. That’s fine. 
Our science are inductive.
All our knowledge was obtained in this way. 
Well, ?
There are some essential points about induction. 
So I must admit it is a reasonable guess.
But is it proofed? 
Is 16 certain or not? Yes or no. 
No. 
conviction. Louder. 
No. 

Now. Good. 
So I put a ? after 16. It is doubtful. 
Now you see what is very important in? reasonable guessing. 
You shouldn't pull it back. That's not good. 
you can guess. 
What you should not do that you believe your own guesses.
Believing a little bit in your guess is healthy. ?
But believe completely your guess, well that's the stand point of savagers, not of educated peoeple. 
So you doubted. And that's not enough. You have to doubted ?
You have to test your guess. 
You have to check it. 
Your guess was a prediction. 
You predicted if I put 4 planes at random, then there will be 16 pieces of space. 
You predicted that. 
BTW, I will tell you it is not very easy to image four planes in space.
except one point, something remarkable happens.
And that we can understand a little by the analogy of the the plane. 

Analogy is another important point in guessing.  

We discussed division of space by planes. 
Space divided by planes. 
But simpler? division of a plane by straight lines. 
For instance, if I divide this plane by just one straight line, then how many parts are in the plane? 
Two?
Two. 
They have name. Call them two half planes.
That's what you wanted to say. 
Two half planes. Good. 
Let's note that. 
Planes divided by lines. 
If you divided by one line, there are two half planes. 
If you divide by two lines, on the blackboard, how many parts are there?
Four. 
Four. 

May I direct your attention to that all four parts are infinite. it's not bounded. You can go away in this part as far as you wish, from the point of intersection. All four parts are infinite.

But if you introduce a third line. ? at any position. Like that. 
Then something happens. 
Then there is one division of the space which is more interesting than the others. It is bounded for all sides. It is finite. How do you call this part?

What is that? You don't know that?
Triangle. 
Yes. You know it. 
It's a triangle. 
So if you introduce 3 lines, then you introduce a triangle. 

I foresaw this difficulty, so I show you this same figure again.

By introducing three lines, you got a triangle finite.?

And in space, if you introduced a fourth plane, then something similar happens. 
You got a finite body. ?
What is the solid body by four planes?
Tetrahedron.

So there is the Tetrahedron. So if you introduce four planes, ?
That is the new things happens. 

After that it's easy to record, to visualize the situation. 
Of course, 
picture, because this is going to infinite.

And how many should there be? 
What did you say? 
Stick to your guess. 

Can you by just looking at the ? Can you? How many?
31:33
How did you ?
Are you sure 

You see you could make mistakes in two ways. 

Some part you may count it twice. 
Fifteen. 
Could you explain us how?
Tetrahedron, your drawn small Tetrahedrons 
There will be one for each edge of the Tetrahedron. 

He is very clever. Very clever. 
Did others follow? Well I think he is right. It seems that he is right. 

You see, you can do it by analogy. 
Consider first the similar case in the plane. 
How many (parts) are there in the plane, given there are three lines? 
Just look at it. 
Loud please. Seven.
Now you can count seven parts in various ways. 
One way in counting is 
finite part is just one. This is the most interesting part. This is triangle. 
The others are infinite. Around it. 
I put my finger here and start counting. 
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One and six make seven. 
Yes, that's good. But not good enough. 
Because this I cannot quite imitate in space. 
Also in the space all the parts are around, but not around in the same way. 
They don't surround in the same way. 
So we must count it in the more sophiscated method.

Tell you how. 
There is really two differnet types of parts. 
This part has the common with the triangle.
How many such? 
Three. 
Loud please.
Three.
